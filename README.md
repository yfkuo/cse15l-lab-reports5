# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together (Week 9)

## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
Design a debugging scenario, and write your report as a conversation on EdStem. It should have:

1. The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don’t actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)


2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)


3. Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.


4. At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
- The file & directory structure needed
- The contents of each file before fixing the bug
- The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
- A description of what to edit to fix the bug
  





## Part 2 – Reflection
In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on. It doesn’t have to be specifically related to a lab writeup, we just want to hear about cool things you learned!
